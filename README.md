## About

The goal of GitBlame is to be the best `git blame` GUI on Windows. This
project is still in the very early stages and is not yet ready for daily
use.

## How to Build

This project requires Visual C# Express 2010 (or better). After cloning the
repository, open `GitBlame\GitBlame.sln` and build it.

[msysgit](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/) must be installed for GitBlame
to function correctly.

## License

GitBlame is licensed under GPL v2, just like git itself. See `COPYING` for
more information.
